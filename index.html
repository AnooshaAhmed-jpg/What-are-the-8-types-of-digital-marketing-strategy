        What it is: Partners (affiliates) promote your product and earn a commission for referred sales or leads.
How it works: you provide creatives/tracking links; affiliates drive traffic; you pay per sale or lead.
Tactics: recruit high-quality affiliates, offer tiered commissions, provide tracking dashboards and creatives, monitor fraud.
KPIs: affiliate-driven revenue, conversion rate, EPC (earnings per click), number of active affiliates.
